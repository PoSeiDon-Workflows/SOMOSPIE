      <abstract>Product: These are Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data for East Tennessee FY16 Lidar Project Level as part of the required deliverables for East Tennessee FY16 Lidar project. Class 2 (ground) lidar points in conjunction with the hydro breaklines and bridge breaklines were used to create a 2.5 feet hydro-flattened Raster DEM. Geographic Extent: This task order requires lidar data to be acquired over 7,863 square miles miles in eastern Tennessee including Davidson, Macon, Monroe, Loudon, Blount, Sevier, Knox, Union, Jefferson, Cocke, Grainger, Hamblen, Greene, Hawkins, Sullivan, Washington, Carter, and Unicoi counties. Dataset Description: East_Tennessee FY16 Lidar project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7meter. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of Tennessee State Plane Zone  NAD83(2011) US Survey Feet, Survey Feet and vertical datum of NAVD88 Geoid12B Survey Feet. Lidar data was delivered as flightline-extent unclassified LAS swaths, as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files, formatted to 7646 individual 7000 ft x 4000 ft tiles in Tennessee State Plane Zone  NAD83(2011) US Survey Feet, Survey Feet and vertical datum of NAVD88 Geoid12B Survey Feet, as tiled Intensity Imagery, and as tiled bare earth DEMs; all tiled to the same 7000 ft x 4000 ft schema. Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in spring of 2016 by Woolpert, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Woolpert established 177  ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area. Additional independent accuracy checkpoints were collected (230 NVA points and 172VVA points) and used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data. 
Five delivery tiles in Area 2 do not have full coverage. The total area of missing data total approximately 0.41 square miles. These tiles exist on the internal boundary with Blount County and are: 2598493SW, 2598493SE, 2612493SW, 2570477SE, 2556461SE. The East Tennessee FY16 Lidar project shares a border with the TN 27 County (Cumberland Plateau) 0.7m NPS  Lidar task order.  A small amount of TN 27 County data was used to fill out coverage in the East Tennessee project.  91 tiles contains TN 27 County data.  Raw swath data is not being delivered for the TN27 County data as only a small portion of the swath was used to fill out coverage.

        <vertaccr>LAS data covering the Eastern Tennessee FY16 Lidar Task Order was compared to independent survey control points to determine the NVA of the LAS Swath and of the Bare-Earth DEM. In addition, this LAS data was compared to independent VVA points. LAS Swath Non-Vegetated Vertical Accuracy (NVA) Tested 0.094 Meter Non vegetated vertical accuracy at a 95 percent confidence level, derived according to NSSDA, in open terrain using 0.048 Meter (RMSEz) x 1.96000 as defined by the National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA); assessed and reported using National Digital Elevation Program (NDEP)/ASPRS Guidelines. Bare-Earth DEM Non-Vegetated Vertical Accuracy (NVA) Tested 0.096 Meter Non vegetated vertical accuracy at a 95 percent confidence level, derived according to NSSDA, in open terrain using 0.049 Meter (RMSEz) x 1.96000 as defined by the National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA); assessed and reported using National Digital Elevation Program (NDEP)/ASPRS Guidelines.</vertaccr>

Using automated scripting routines within ArcMap, an ERDAS Imagine IMG file was created for each tile. Each surface is reviewed using Global Mapper to check for any surface anomalies or incorrect elevations found within the surface.</procdesc>
