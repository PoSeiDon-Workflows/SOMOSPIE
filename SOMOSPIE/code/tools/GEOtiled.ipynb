    "# GEOtiled: A Scalable Workflow for Generating Large Datasets of High-Resolution Terrain Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Terrain parameters such as slope, aspect and hillshading can be computed from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) which is a representation of elevation data of the surface of the earth. In SOMOSPIE these terrrain parameters are used to downscale satellite-derived soil moisture data.\n",
    "\n",
    "GEOtiled comprises three stages: (i) the partition of the DEM into tiles, each with a buffer region; (ii) the computation of the terrain parameters for each individual tile; and finally, (iii) the generation of a mosaic for each parameter from the tiles by averaging the values of the pixels that overlap between the tiles (i.e., pixels within the buffer regions). \n",

    "This notebook uses DEMs from [USGS 3DEP products](https://www.usgs.gov/3d-elevation-program/about-3dep-products-services) to compute 3 topographic parameters: Aspect, Hillshading and Slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the workflow on this notebook, go to [USGS Data Download Application](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/#/elevation) and use the map to look for available DEM data. Once you have selected a specific region and resolution, you can get a txt file with all the individual download links for the tiles corresponding to your selection. This txt file will serve as input to this notebook which uses the links to download the tiles and compute the parameters.\n",
