    "# Computing terrain parameters from Digital Elevation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Topographic parameters such as slope and aspect can be computed from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) which is a representation of elevation data of the surface of the earth. In SOMOSPIE these terrrain parameters are used to downscale satellite-derived soil moisture data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses DEMs from [USGS 3DEP products](https://www.usgs.gov/3d-elevation-program/about-3dep-products-services) to compute 3 topographic parameters: Hillshading, Aspect and Slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from USGS standard DEMs is distributed in tiles that cover a fixed geographic area and these tiles can be merged to build a DEM for a larger region. \n",

    "Before running the workflow on this notebook, go to [USGS Data Download Application](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/#/elevation) and use the map to look for available DEM data. Once you have selected a specific region and resolution, you can get a txt file with all the individual download links for the tiles corresponding to your selection. This txt file will serve as input to this notebook which uses the links to download the tiles and merges them into a single DEM file to then compute terrain parameters using GDAL.\n",

    "The terrain parameters are by default generated as GeoTIFF files, so this notebook includes the option to change their format and stack them if needed."
