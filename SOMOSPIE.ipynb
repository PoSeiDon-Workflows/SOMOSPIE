    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Soil moisture is a critical variable that links climate dynamics with water and food security. It regulates land-atmosphere interactions (e.g., via evapotranspiration--the loss of water from evaporation and plant transpiration to the atmosphere), and it is directly linked with plant productivity and survival. Information on soil moisture is important to design appropriate irrigation strategies to increase crop yield, and long-term soil moisture coupled with climate information provides insights into trends and potential agricultural thresholds and risks. Thus, information on soil moisture is a key factor to inform and enable precision agriculture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current availability in soil moisture data over large areas comes from remote sensing (i.e., satellites with radar sensors) which provide daily, nearly global coverage of soil moisture. However, satellite soil moisture datasets have a major shortcoming in that they are limited to coarse spatial resolution (generally no finer than tens of kilometers).\n",
    "\n",
    "There do exist at higher resolution other geographic datasets (e.g., climatic, geological, and topographic) that are intimately related to soil moisture values. SOMOSPIE is meant to be a general-purpose tool for using such datasets to downscale (i.e., increase resolution) satelite-based soil moisture products. This Jupyter Notebook is a result of a collaboration between computer scientists of the Global Computing Laboratory at the Universtiy of Tennessee, Knoxville and soil scientists at the University of Delware (funded by NSF awards #1724843 and #1854312)."
